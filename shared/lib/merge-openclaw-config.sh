# merge-openclaw-config.sh - Merge remote (MinIO) and local (Worker) openclaw.json

# Implementation: thin wrapper around the shared Python package
# ``agentteams_openclaw_merge`` (see shared/python/agentteams_openclaw_merge).
# Merge semantics are documented in that module's MERGE_RULES docstring.
#
# Usage (as sourced function):
#   source /opt/agentteams/scripts/lib/merge-openclaw-config.sh
#   merge_openclaw_config <remote_path> <local_path> [<output_path>]
#
# If output_path is omitted, writes merged result to local_path.
