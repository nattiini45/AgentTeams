# Manager

The Manager is the coordinator agent in AgentTeams. It orchestrates Workers, manages Teams, handles Human interactions, and configures the Higress gateway. The Manager runs as a dedicated container and communicates with Workers and Humans through Matrix rooms.

## Manager Runtimes

The Manager supports two runtimes, selected via `AGENTTEAMS_MANAGER_RUNTIME` or Helm `manager.runtime`:

| Runtime | Image | Behavior |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `openclaw` (default) | `agentteams-manager` | OpenClaw gateway; primary Matrix channel uses the message tool pattern |
| `copaw` | `agentteams-manager-copaw` | Python CoPaw workspace; Matrix traffic uses `copaw channels send` CLI |

Hermes, OpenHuman, and QwenPaw are **Worker-only** runtimes — they cannot serve as Manager.

## Directory Structure

The Manager's agent-facing content lives in [`manager/agent/`](../../manager/agent/) and is copied to `/opt/hiclaw/agent/` in the image. The `upgrade-builtins.sh` script syncs these files into the Manager workspace at startup.

## Manager Skills

The Manager has 19 skill modules in [`manager/agent/skills/`](../../manager/agent/skills/). Each skill directory contains a `SKILL.md` (instructions for the agent), optional `scripts/` (executable helpers), and optional `references/` (detailed docs).

| Skill | Purpose |

| `channel-management` | Create and manage Matrix channels |
| `escalation-management` | Handle escalation protocols |
| `file-sync-management` | Manage MinIO file synchronization |
| `git-delegation-management` | Delegate git operations to workers |
| `hiclaw-find-worker` | Find and query workers |
| `human-management` | Manage human participants |
| `matrix-server-management` | Matrix server administration |
| `mcp-server-management` | Create and configure MCP servers |
| `mcporter` | MCP tool calling via CLI |
| `model-switch` | Switch LLM models |
| `project-management` | Create and manage projects |
| `provider-management` | Manage LLM providers |
| `service-publishing` | Publish services |
| `session-recovery` | Recover from session interruptions |
| `task-coordination` | Coordinate tasks across workers |
| `task-management` | Create, assign, and track tasks |
| `team-management` | Create and manage teams |
| `worker-management` | Create, configure, and manage workers |
| `worker-model-switch` | Switch models for specific workers |

## Prompt Fragments

The [`manager/agent/fragments/`](../../manager/agent/fragments/) directory contains composable prompt fragments that are assembled into the final AGENTS.md and HEARTBEAT.md:

**AGENTS fragments:**
- `header-openclaw.md` / `header-copaw.md` — Runtime-specific headers
- `every-session.md` — Per-session instructions
- `controller-api.md` — Controller API reference
- `management-skills.md` — Skill management
- `tools.md` — Available tools
- `memory.md` — Memory management
- `safety.md` — Safety guidelines
- `gotchas-openclaw.md` / `gotchas-copaw.md` — Runtime-specific gotchas
- `group-rooms-*.md` — Room management by runtime
- `message-sending-*.md` — Message sending by runtime
- `host-files.md` — File system access
- `minio.md` — MinIO integration

**HEARTBEAT fragments:**
- `header-openclaw.md` / `header-copaw.md` — Runtime-specific headers
- `openclaw-body.md` / `copaw-body.md` — Runtime-specific body
- `step-01-state.md` — State check step
- `copaw-cli-reference.md` — CoPaw CLI reference

## Manager Container

### Dockerfiles

- [`manager/Dockerfile`](../../manager/Dockerfile) — OpenClaw-based Manager (from `openclaw-base`; bundles `hiclaw` CLI from controller image)
- [`manager/Dockerfile.copaw`](../../manager/Dockerfile.copaw) — CoPaw-based Manager (Python venv + CoPaw from PyPI)

### Bootstrap Chain

The Manager startup sequence is:

1. **Container entrypoint** starts supervisord (local) or direct process (K8s)
2. **`start-manager-agent.sh`** — Main bootstrap script
   - Detects runtime (`AGENTTEAMS_RUNTIME`: local/embedded/aliyun/k8s)
   - Runs bootstrap steps from [`manager/scripts/lib/bootstrap/`](../../manager/scripts/lib/bootstrap/)
3. **`upgrade-builtins.sh`** — Syncs built-in agent files to workspace
4. **`render-manager-prompts.sh`** — Renders prompt templates with variable substitution
5. **Runtime start** — Launches OpenClaw or CoPaw manager process

### Bootstrap Steps

Bootstrap scripts in [`manager/scripts/lib/bootstrap/`](../../manager/scripts/lib/bootstrap/):

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `pre-start.sh` | Pre-flight checks |
| `secrets.sh` | Secret loading and validation |
| `matrix-token.sh` | Matrix authentication |
| `workspace.sh` | Workspace directory setup |
| `local.sh` | Local-mode specific setup |
| `higress.sh` | Higress gateway configuration |
| `container-runtime.sh` | Docker/Podman runtime setup |
| `runtime.sh` | Runtime-specific initialization |
| `start-runtime.sh` | Launch the agent runtime |
| `admin-dm.sh` | Admin DM room setup |
| `cloud-sync.sh` | Cloud synchronization |
| `cloud-validate.sh` | Cloud config validation |
| `cms-plugin.sh` | CMS plugin setup |
| `workers.sh` | Worker initialization |
| `openclaw-config.sh` | OpenClaw configuration |

### Configuration

- [`manager/configs/`](../../manager/configs/) — Init-time configuration templates
- [`manager/configs/known-models.json`](../../manager/configs/known-models.json) — Known LLM model definitions
- [`manager/configs/manager-openclaw.json.tmpl`](../../manager/configs/manager-openclaw.json.tmpl) — OpenClaw Manager config template
- [`manager/configs/mcp-templates/`](../../manager/configs/mcp-templates/) — MCP server templates

## Agent-Facing Content Conventions

All files under `manager/agent/` are **read by the Agent at runtime**, not by human developers. Writing conventions:

- **Use second-person voice** — "You are the Manager...", "Your responsibilities include..."
- **SKILL.md** — Instruct the agent directly: "Use this script to...", "Run `mcporter list` to see..."
- **No third-person** — Never write "Manager can call..." or "This skill provides..."
- **Scripts** — Write log output from the system's perspective, with the agent as the implied operator
